                  <p class="about">Hello, welcome to my website! I'm currently studying for my bachelors degree in computer science at Allegheny College.
                    I've been fascinated by computers since I was a teenager, so computer science was an obvious fit. Since attending
                    college, I've also peaked interest in the graphs and relevance of economics to which I chose to be my minor.</p>
                  <p>I am currently employeed at Geisinger Medical Center as a foodservice worker and have been for the last 2 years.
                    As an occasional B-code lead I am responsible for supervising the processes and food service team on a daily basis.
                    I am also on the executive board for Gator Activities Programming as the current VP of Internal Operations.</p>
