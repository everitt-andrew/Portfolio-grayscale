                  <p>In Software Innovations, we completed additional development of GatorGrader. Developed at Allegheny College, the tool is used
                  to assess computer science students' work. In order to enhance the program, we have worked in a software engineering environment where
                  small teams tackle issues. My group, which consisted of Simon, Zach, Austin, Christian, and myself worked on LaTeX integration. This issue
                  was important because seniors use LaTeX during the development of their final project and it lacked any GatorGrader support. We started by
                  creating a sample repository and quickly realized that implementing the ability for GatorGrader to examine multiple line fragments would be
                  crucial to the final product. Afterwards, we created a command line argument, necessary documentation to understand how to test for regular
                  expressions (regex), and the appropriate tests to maintain code coverage. </p>
