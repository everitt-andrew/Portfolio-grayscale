                  <h3>Blog Post for 14 February 2019:</h3>
                  <p>In Software Innovations, we are working on additional development of GatorGrader. Developed at Allegheny College, the tool is used
                  to assess computer science students' work. In order to enhance the program, we have worked in a software engineering environment where
                  small teams tackle issues. This week, my group started working on LaTeX integration. This is important because seniors use LaTeX during
                  the development of their final project. Moving forward, we will be implementing the ability for GatorGrader to examine multiple line
                  fragments as well as a linting tool for LaTeX files. If you have any comments or questions, please contact me using the information
                  at the bottom of the page and look forward to future updates on the project. </p>
